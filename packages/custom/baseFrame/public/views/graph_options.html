<div id="graph-options">
    (option 1) For number of occurrences and co-occurrences, use:

(option 1.a) regular numbers

(option 1.b) square root () of the regular numbers

(option 1.c) log-scaled (base 2)

The above option defines a scaling for all the general numbers (occurrences of a tag and co-occurrences in SO)

to scale them down. If 1.b or 1.c is selected, then all the above values when considering the whole SO are

affected (i.e., the occurrences of a term in a bug or developers’ records is not affected; this is the next option).

(option 2) For counting a tag in txt (a bug or a developer’s record), use:

(option 2.a) regular counts

(option 2.b) square root () of the regular counts

(option 2.c) log (regular counts) –with base 2

The above option defines a scaling for all the counted numbers (occurrences of a tag in a piece of text which

can be B or D) to scale them down. If 2.b or 2.c is selected, then all the above values of occurrence(i, B) and

occurrence(i, D) in Cosine and Jaccard similarity will be affected.

(option 3.a) Use Cosine similarity

(option 3.a.1) Use adjusted node weights (based on their occurrences in SO)

(option 3.b) Use Jaccard similarity

(option 3.b.1) Use adjusted node weights (based on their occurrences in a piece of given text)

(option 3.b.2) For determining matching score between two graphs, also consider edges’ overlaps

All the above check boxes are not selected by default.

(option 4.a) Digraph

(option 4.b) Undirected graph
