#Software Expertise

## Have the system up and running:

When cloning this repo, also clone [this](https://github.com/TaskAssignment/TaskAssignment.github.io) on the same folder where you cloned this.

This will ensure that the online documentation found [here](https://TaskAssignment.github.io/api) is up to date without the need of generating it manually. After setting it up according to the following instructions, anytime you commit, it will also commit the html generated by the `jsdoc`.

### Linux:
OBS: All these steps require you to be on the root folder of this repo, unless otherwise stated.

1. Install git, mongodb (3.2.6), nodejs (6.2.2) and npm (3.9.6)
2. Run `cp post-commit.sample .git/hooks/post-commit`
3. Run `cp pre-push.sample .git/hooks/pre-push`
4. Make these two files executable: `chmod +x .git/hooks/post-commit .git/hooks/pre-push`
2. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
3. Make sure that mongodb is running.
4. Run `node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp.js` to run the server. (If you want to use `gulp`, you have to install it globally `$ [sudo] npm install gulp -g`)
5. Go to [localhost](http://localhost:3000) and enjoy it!

#### Troubleshooting:

If `npm install` or `gulp` fails it probably means that some dependencies are not up to date. Try running `[sudo] npm update -g` to update npm and gulp or `npm update` to update the local dependencies.
