#Software Expertise

## Have the system up and running:

When cloning this repo, also clone [the API documentation](https://github.com/TaskAssignment/TaskAssignment.github.io) on the same folder where you cloned this.

This will ensure that the online documentation found [here](https://TaskAssignment.github.io/api) is up to date without the need of generating it manually. After setting it up according to the following instructions, anytime you commit, it will also commit the html generated by the `jsdoc`.

### Linux:
OBS: All these steps require you to be on the root folder of this repo, unless otherwise stated.

1. Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) in your computer
2. Clone [the API documentation](https://github.com/TaskAssignment/TaskAssignment.github.io) on the same folder where you cloned this
3. Run `cp post-commit.sample .git/hooks/post-commit`
4. Run `cp pre-push.sample .git/hooks/pre-push`
5. Make these two files executable: `chmod +x .git/hooks/post-commit .git/hooks/pre-push`
6. Run `vagrant up`. This will create the VM, install all the dependencies and start
mongodb. The first time may take several minutes to complete, because it will install
**all** the dependencies.
7. Run `vagrant ssh` to access the VM.
8. Go to `/vagrant` to access the shared folder (this folder). Once inside it, run `node --debug server.js` to start the server.
9. Go to [localhost](http://localhost:3000) and enjoy it!

#### Troubleshooting:

If `npm install` fails it probably means that some dependencies are not up to date. Try `[sudo] npm update -g` to update npm and try to install the dependencies again.
