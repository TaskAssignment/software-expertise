#Software Expertise

## Have the system up and running by:

### Linux:
1. Install git.
2. Install mongodb 3.2.6
3. Install nodejs 6.1.0 and npm 3.8.6
4. Install gulp globally `$ [sudo] npm install gulp -g`
5. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies
6. Run `gulp` in the root directory of this project to run the server.
7. Go to [localhost](http://localhost:3000) and enjoy it!

#### Troubleshooting:

If `npm install` or `gulp` fails it probably means that some dependencies are not up to date. Try running `[sudo] npm update -g` to update npm and gulp or `npm update` to update the local dependencies.
